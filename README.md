# Project Name 
### Python_Challenge 
The objective of this project is to design a python script that reads a CSV file, analyzes the records and prints the results with the calculated value of the two dataset “PyBank” and “PyPoll”.
# Project Prerequisite
This project required several stages to be completed before starting the project. Some of the examples are setting of the SSH keys in GitHub and Gitlab, cloning the repositories, and creating python path and environment.
# PyBank Summary
In this project, a CSV file named “election_data.csv” was provided and we had to write python scripts to determine the following result : 
* The total number of months 
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses"
* The average changes in "Profit/Losses"
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) 
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)
The results were then exported to a text file named “election_results.txt” using the open() function in write mode ('w').
# PyPoll Summary
Similarly, this project was also provided with a CSV file called “election_data.csv. We had to write python script to find the following result:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

When the script was runned, it calculated the required values, and printed the results to the terminal. It was then exported to the election_results.txt file.
# Challenges
One of the most challenging factors about this project was conceptualizing the codes. Several attempts, testing, critical thinking and organization were required to get the results. The line of code responsible for determining the winner of the election based on the popular vote was one of the challenges I faced during the coding. “winner = max(candidates_count, key=candidates_count.get)”. I was able to understand better with Learning Assistant program Ask BSC.
